At a high level, Cass is already the perfect substrate for ACE‑style “evolving playbooks” and Claude Diary‑style reflection — it’s your cross‑agent, cross‑tool episodic memory. The missing pieces are:

A thin diary layer that distills raw sessions into structured “episodes”.

A reflection layer (ACE‑style Generator / Reflector / Curator) that turns episodes into bulletized playbooks.

A way to feed those playbooks + Cass search back into AGENTS.md / CLAUDE.md and into live agent runs.

Below is a concrete design for that whole stack.

0. Mental model: who does what?
Let’s line up the pieces:

Cass

Unifies all agent logs (Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, Gemini, Aider, ChatGPT, Pi-Agent, …) into a Conversation → Message → Snippet model, stored in SQLite + Tantivy, with fast prefix/wildcard search, timeline, context, export, and a very agent‑friendly --robot mode. 
GitHub
+1

Designed for agents: capabilities, introspect, robot-docs, forgiving CLI syntax, structured JSON/JSONL, token budget controls, etc. 
GitHub

Claude Diary

Has a /diary command that logs per‑session summaries (accomplished work, design decisions, challenges, preferences, PR feedback) into ~/.claude/memory/diary/YYYY-MM-DD-session-N.md. 
Lance's Blog

Has /reflect that scans diary entries, looks for rule violations and patterns, and updates CLAUDE.md with one‑line bullets; stores reflections and a processed.log so entries are not double processed. 
Lance's Blog

ACE (Agentic Context Engineering)

Treats context as an evolving playbook, not a single prompt. 
ar5iv
+1

Uses three roles:

Generator: produces reasoning trajectories (your coding sessions & tool calls).

Reflector: reads those trajectories + feedback and extracts concrete lessons.

Curator: merges those lessons into structured bullets with metadata (ID, helpful/harmful counters, etc.) via incremental delta updates and grow‑and‑refine (dedup, prune redundancy). 
ar5iv

Avoids brevity bias and context collapse by never rewriting the whole context — only applying small deltas. 
ar5iv
+1

Your Cass gives you an amazing Generator substrate – rich logs from many agents and tools in one place, with search/aggregation/exports already solved. We just have to build:

A Cass Diary layer (episodic summaries).

An ACE‑style Cass Playbook layer (structured bullets).

A routing layer that plugs this into AGENTS.md / CLAUDE.md and live agent workflows.

1. Data model: make Cass the source of truth for “experience”
Let’s define a few entities on top of Cass’s existing index.

1.1 Sessions (what Cass already knows)
Cass already normalizes logs from many agents into a model like:

Session (Conversation)
  - source_path: path to raw log (JSONL, SQLite row, markdown file, …)
  - agent: "claude" | "codex" | "cursor" | …
  - workspace: filesystem root of project, where applicable
  - created_at: timestamp
  - messages: indexed messages with title/content, msg_idx, role, etc.
Internally that’s stored in agent_search.db and indexed in a Tantivy index under ~/.local/share/coding-agent-search (or platform equivalent), with fields like agent, workspace, source_path, title, content, plus *_prefix and a preview field for fast prefix search. 
GitHub

You already expose this via:

cass search "..." --robot – returns hits with source_path, line_number, agent, preview, etc.

cass expand <session> -n <line> -C 5 --json – zoom around a particular message. 
GitHub

cass export <session> --format markdown|html|json – full conversations. 
GitHub

These are the “reasoning trajectories” ACE calls Generator outputs.

1.2 New: Cass diary entries (episodic layer)
Add a diary layer on top of Cass, conceptually similar to Claude Diary but built from Cass logs:

CassDiaryEntry
  id: stable hash (e.g. hash(source_path + "diary-v1"))
  session_path: original session log path
  agent: "claude" | "cursor" | …    // from Cass fields
  workspace: repo path or nil
  created_at: ISO timestamp
  status: success | failure | mixed
  tags: [ "auth", "bugfix", "rust", "infra", ... ]
  summary: freeform markdown
  design_decisions: list of bullets
  mistakes_and_fixes: list of bullets
  user_preferences: list of bullets
  tooling_insights: list of bullets (use of Cass, BV, etc.)
Storage:

Global diary directory:

~/.cass/memory/diary/YYYY-MM-DD-session-<short-hash>.md

Optional per‑repo diaries (for AGENTS.md alignment):

<workspace>/.agent-memory/diary/YYYY-MM-DD-session-<short-hash>.md

This mirrors Claude Diary’s directory scheme but moves it into a Cass‑centric namespace. 
Lance's Blog

1.3 New: ACE‑style bullets / playbooks (procedural layer)
Now add an ACE‑style bullet store, separate from the diaries:

// ~/.cass/memory/playbooks/global-playbook.jsonl
{
  "id": "cass-global-0012",
  "scope": { "type": "global" },                 // or { "type": "workspace", "path": "…" }
  "category": "git_workflow",                    // freeform
  "content": "Make small, atomic commits; never mix refactors and behavior changes.",
  "helpful_count": 3,
  "harmful_count": 0,
  "created_at": "2025-12-05T21:31:00Z",
  "last_updated": "2025-12-07T02:10:00Z",
  "source": [
    {
      "diary_path": "~/.cass/memory/diary/2025-12-05-session-abc.md",
      "session_path": "~/.claude/projects/devshop/2025-12-05-123.jsonl"
    }
  ]
}
Per‑repo playbook:

<workspace>/.agent-memory/playbook.jsonl
Critically, this is exactly the kind of “bullet with metadata + content” that ACE describes: ID + helpful/harmful counters + small units like reusable strategies, common failure modes, or domain concepts. 
ar5iv

2. Pipeline overview
Let’s put the whole thing together:

Online usage (during coding):

Agent loads AGENTS.md / CLAUDE.md for baseline rules.

Agent uses Cass search/expand to pull episodic memory (similar sessions).

Optionally also pulls a subset of relevant bullets from the playbook and includes them in context.

Post‑hoc diary generation (Cass Diary layer):

A small orchestrator script finds new sessions via Cass (timeline or recency filters).

For each unprocessed session:

cass export → pass transcript to LLM with a “/diary”‑style prompt.

Write a CassDiaryEntry .md file.

Log it in ~/.cass/memory/diary/processed.log to avoid duplicates.

Reflection & ACE‑style playbook updates:

A reflection script periodically:

Loads unprocessed CassDiaryEntries for a given scope (global or workspace).

Loads current playbook file (global and/or repo).

Asks a Reflector LLM to:

Identify rule violations / weak rules.

Propose new bullets / updates (with suggested helpful/harmful counters).

A Curator script merges those bullet “deltas” into the playbook files, incrementing counters and deduping content.

Projection back into AGENTS.md / CLAUDE.md:

A final “projection” script takes the current playbook and creates:

A short curated subset for AGENTS.md (per repo).

Persistent user‑level instructions in ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md (or similar) for global behaviors.

This mirrors the Claude Diary /diary + /reflect pattern, but:

Uses Cass to pull from all agents and tools, not just Claude Code.

Uses ACE’s bullet + delta + grow‑and‑refine structure for context files. 
Lance's Blog
+1

3. Step‑by‑step: integrating Cass into online agent workflows
Your README already ships a ready‑to‑paste blurb for AGENTS.md / CLAUDE.md that teaches agents to use Cass: cass health, cass search, cass view, cass expand, plus the eternal warning “NEVER run bare cass — always use --robot or --json”. 
GitHub
+1

3.1 AGENTS.md / CLAUDE.md additions
Extend your existing blurb with a memory‑first workflow that references the diary & playbook layers:

## Cass: Episodic + Playbook Memory (ACE-style)

Before solving a non-trivial task from scratch:

1. Use Cass to look for similar past work:
   - `cass search "<short summary of the task>" --robot --limit 5 --fields summary --workspace <this repo> --days 30`
   - If you find promising hits, call `cass expand` to pull 3–5 messages of context around the result.

2. Use the playbook file for this repo:
   - Load `.agent-memory/playbook.jsonl` (if it exists).
   - Prioritize strategies with high `helpful_count` and low `harmful_count` that match this task.

When finishing a significant session (e.g., new feature, major bug fix):

- If asked or if the changes seem important, produce a diary entry via tools that call Cass:
  - Summarize what changed, key design decisions, mistakes, and preferences.
That gives live agents an explicit habit: search Cass, then respect the playbook.

3.2 How an agent should call Cass in practice
You’ve already made Cass agent‑friendly:

cass capabilities --json and cass introspect --json to discover schema. 
GitHub

Forgiving CLI: fixes typos like cass serach, -robot, --limt, plus aliasing find/query/q → search. 
GitHub
+1

Output is always JSON on stdout with diagnostics on stderr; there’s --max-tokens, --fields, --max-content-length, --limit to keep payload small. 
GitHub
+1

A canonical online retrieval pattern for agents working in a repo:

# 1. Check Cass is healthy
cass health

# 2. Fetch top 5 similar sessions in this repo in the last 30 days
cass search "react auth token refresh bug" \
  --robot \
  --fields summary \
  --limit 5 \
  --workspace /path/to/repo \
  --days 30 \
  --max-tokens 1500

# 3. For any promising hit, expand context
cass expand "/path/from/hit/session.jsonl" -n 42 -C 5 --json
The agent harness should:

Derive a short search query (“goal string”) from the user’s task + file names.

Cache Cass results in memory for the current session to avoid repeated calls.

Only pass a subset of hits/expanded contexts into the model, using --fields summary + --max-content-length and internal scoring (relevance to current files, file paths, etc.).

4. Cass Diary layer: generating episodic summaries from Cass logs
Now the core of the integration: using Cass to generate Claude‑Diary‑style entries offline.

4.1 Selecting sessions to diary
Use Cass’s existing timeline + filtering to find “new” sessions:

# Example: sessions in last 24h per agent
cass timeline --since 1d --aggregate agent,workspace,date --json
Then, maintain a simple ~/.cass/memory/diary/processed.log containing session_path hashes.

Basic algorithm (Python/pseudocode):

new_sessions = list_sessions_from_cass_since(last_run_timestamp)
unprocessed = [s for s in new_sessions if hash(s.path) not in processed_log]
You can detect sessions worth summarizing using heuristics:

Long conversations (via internal message counts / timeline + index stats).

Sessions whose content includes keywords like "PR feedback", "postmortem", "root cause", "refactor", "incident", etc. (via cass search with --aggregate or filtering by workspace). 
GitHub

4.2 Export + LLM prompt for diaries
For each candidate session:

cass export /path/to/session.jsonl --format markdown --include-tools -o /tmp/cass-session.md
Then feed /tmp/cass-session.md into your LLM of choice with a prompt adapted from Claude Diary’s /diary command: 
Lance's Blog

System prompt (sketch)
You are a reflection assistant. You are given the full transcript of a coding agent session plus any tool outputs.
Produce a Cass diary entry in strict JSON with fields:

status: "success" | "failure" | "mixed"

tags: short list of task/domain tags

summary: 3–7 bullet summary of what was accomplished

design_decisions: bullets describing key design or API decisions and their rationale

mistakes_and_fixes: bullets summarizing errors, missteps, and how they were fixed

user_preferences: bullets describing discovered preferences about style, workflow, tools

tooling_insights: bullets with insights about how to use tools (Cass, BV, tests, etc.)
Only use information from the transcript. Be concise but specific.

Then wrap it into your Markdown format:

---
session_path: ...
agent: ...
workspace: ...
created_at: ...
status: ...
tags: [...]
---

# Summary
- ...

# Design decisions
- ...

# Mistakes and fixes
- ...

# User preferences
- ...

# Tooling insights
- ...
Save that to ~/.cass/memory/diary/YYYY-MM-DD-session-<hash>.md and append the hash to processed.log.

This is almost identical in spirit to Lance’s design, just pointing at Cass instead of Claude session logs. 
Lance's Blog

5. ACE‑style reflection on diaries → playbook bullets
Now we layer ACE on top of the diaries.

5.1 Reflector input and output
A reflection run is roughly:

Input:

A set of diary entries (global and/or per‑workspace) that have not yet been reflected.

The current playbook.jsonl for the same scope.

Output:

A list of bullet deltas:

add_bullet – new bullet with metadata.

update_bullet – adjust helpful_count / harmful_count or tweak wording.

deprecate_bullet – mark bullet as outdated or harmful.

This is exactly Generator + Reflector + Curator from ACE, where:

Generator = the original coding sessions already stored in Cass.

Reflector = LLM pass over diaries.

Curator = deterministic merging of bullet deltas into the playbook. 
ar5iv

Reflector prompt sketch:

You are a Reflector in an Agentic Context Engineering system.
You are given:

A list of Cass diary entries (each is a short markdown file produced after coding sessions).

The current playbook bullets, each with id, content, helpful_count, harmful_count, category, and scope.
Your job:

Identify new lessons: strategies, heuristics, anti-patterns, or user preferences that would be useful across future sessions.

Check where diaries show violations of existing bullets (e.g., not running tests, misusing git, ignoring security guidelines).

Propose a small number of deltas:

add_bullet when a truly new lesson appears.

update_bullet when evidence suggests a rule should be strengthened, clarified, or weakened.

deprecate_bullet when a rule appears harmful or obsolete.
Represent your output as strict JSON:

{ "deltas": [ ... ] }
Each delta might look like:

{
  "type": "add_bullet",
  "category": "testing",
  "scope": { "type": "workspace", "path": "/Users/me/devshop" },
  "content": "Before running the full test suite, run targeted tests for files you changed to get faster feedback.",
  "initial_helpful_count": 1,
  "initial_harmful_count": 0,
  "sources": [
    { "diary_path": "...", "session_path": "..." }
  ]
}
or:

{
  "type": "update_bullet",
  "id": "cass-global-0012",
  "delta_helpful": 1,
  "delta_harmful": 0,
  "note": "Rule was followed and produced a clean PR with minimal feedback."
}
5.2 Curator script (non‑LLM; prevents collapse)
The Curator is a small deterministic script (Rust or Python) that:

Loads playbook.jsonl into memory.

For each add_bullet:

Computes a “fingerprint” (e.g., normalized text + category).

Searches existing bullets for high similarity (string ratio or embedding if you want).

If similar bullet exists:

Merge by incrementing helpful_count, optionally appending evidence.

Else:

Assign a new id and append bullet.

For each update_bullet:

Locate bullet by ID and adjust counters.

For each deprecate_bullet:

Set a deprecated: true flag or move to an archive file.

This is exactly ACE’s incremental delta + grow‑and‑refine principle: localized updates + periodic dedup, never rewriting the whole context. 
ar5iv

You can also occasionally run a lazy refinement step:

Remove bullets with helpful_count = 0 and harmful_count >= 2.

Merge highly similar bullets by:

Keeping the best‑written one.

Summing counts.

Merging evidence lists.

6. Projecting the playbook back into AGENTS.md / CLAUDE.md
You don’t necessarily want to shove the full playbook (which could grow huge) into AGENTS.md or CLAUDE.md. Instead, treat those files as curated front‑ends of the playbook.

6.1 Repo‑level AGENTS.md
For each repo:

playbook.jsonl is the source of truth.

A small script generates an AGENTS.md section such as:

## Agent Playbook (auto-generated from Cass)

These rules are synthesized from past sessions across Claude, Cursor, Codex, and other agents, using Cass + reflection.

### Testing (top 5 rules)

1. [3× helpful] Run `pnpm test` for the current package before committing, and rerun after updating dependencies.
2. [2× helpful] For flaky tests, reproduce in isolation with `pnpm vitest run -t "<test name>"` and document any nondeterminism.
3. [1× helpful] After moving files, always run `pnpm lint --filter <project_name>` to validate TypeScript and ESLint rules.

### Git workflow

1. [4× helpful] Make small, atomic commits; don’t mix refactors and behavior changes.
2. [2× helpful] Use branch names like `feature/<area>-<summary>` so they group naturally in history.
The script:

Sorts bullets by scope (matching repo path) and helpful_count - harmful_count.

Emits the top N per category as Markdown.

6.2 User‑level CLAUDE.md (or similar)
Similarly, maintain a global playbook projection for user‑wide preferences and patterns (commit style, documentation practices, general testing habits, etc.). Claude Diary already writes to ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md; you can:

Either let your reflector write directly into that file.

Or create a ~/.cass/memory/CLAUDE.playbook.jsonl and have a projection step that rewrites the bullet section of CLAUDE.md.

The key is to keep updates delta‑based and bulletized to avoid context collapse for your own memory files as well. 
ar5iv

7. Using Cass again during reflection: sampling & focusing
Cass isn’t only useful as a source of transcripts; it can help choose what to reflect on:

Use cass search "error" --robot --aggregate workspace,date to find hotspots (sessions with lots of errors logged).

Use cass search "PR feedback" --agent claude --days 7 to focus reflection on sessions that involved human review feedback.

Use cass context <session> (once you’ve wired that) to pull related sessions in the same repo/day to treat as a clustered episode.

This is very aligned with ACE’s notion of revisiting queries over multiple epochs to refine contexts, and with Claude Diary’s suggestion to look at PR feedback, testing practices, and code quality patterns. 
Lance's Blog
+1

8. Where Cass’s specific features shine in this stack
A few nice synergies with features you’ve already built:

Robot‑first design
Agents can discover how to use Cass via cass capabilities, cass introspect, and cass robot-docs, instead of hard‑coding schemas. This makes your diary/ACE integration easier to evolve — agents can introspect at runtime. 
GitHub
+1

Token budget knobs
--fields, --max-content-length, --max-tokens, and --limit let Cass act as the first stage of context compression before LLM reflection. During diary generation, you can:

First run cass search to find only the most relevant parts of long sessions.

Then run cass expand only around those bits, instead of exporting 20K‑line logs.

Structured error reporting
The error.code, kind, hint, and retryable fields make it safe for agents to schedule diary / reflection jobs: they can detect index_missing and instruct the user to run cass index --full instead of hallucinating. 
GitHub

Timeline + aggregation
cass timeline and --aggregate options can be used to:

Trigger reflection after periods of heavy activity.

Focus reflection on projects with lots of churn. 
GitHub
+1

Potential future: Playbook as another Cass “agent”
You could register the playbook files as another virtual “agent” (e.g., agent = "playbook" in Tantivy + SQLite), letting Cass search directly over bullets and diaries:

cass search "jwt auth security" --agent playbook --robot
This would give you a unified search UX over both raw sessions and distilled lessons.

9. Concrete “first milestone” you could implement
To keep this realistic, here’s a minimal but fully coherent v1 you could build:

Add a tiny helper script: cass-session-diary

Inputs: session_path, workspace, agent.

Internally:

cass export <session_path> --format markdown --include-tools.

Prompt an LLM (Claude/GPT) to output your CassDiaryEntry JSON.

Render to markdown and write it to ~/.cass/memory/diary.

Append to processed.log.

Add a reflection script: cass-reflect-playbook

Takes --scope global or --workspace <path>.

Loads unprocessed diary entries for that scope.

Loads playbook.jsonl.

Calls an LLM Reflector to produce bullet deltas.

Runs a Curator function (in the script) to merge into the playbook file.

Writes a reflections.log with references to processed diary IDs (similar to Claude Diary’s processed.log). 
Lance's Blog

Add an AGENTS.md generator script

Reads playbook.jsonl for the repo.

Writes or updates an ## Agent Playbook (auto-generated) section in AGENTS.md using top bullets.

Optionally, surface “reflection commands” in Cass

e.g. cass reflect --workspace /path/to/repo → just wraps the script.

At that point you would have:

Cass as the episodic memory substrate (what happened).

A Cass Diary layer summarizing important episodes.

An ACE‑style reflection layer turning those episodes into structured, evolving playbooks.

AGENTS.md / CLAUDE.md being refreshed from that playbook, avoiding context collapse.

And crucially, all of that is built on capabilities Cass already has: indexing, fast search, export, timeline, robot‑friendly structured outputs, and your existing AGENTS.md / CLAUDE.md blurb.

Reasoned for 11m 16s
Here’s a more general, Cass‑centric design that works for any coding agent and a concrete single‑file Bun/TypeScript CLI that uses the Vercel AI SDK for the ACE‑style reflection loop.

I’ll first outline the behavior so the code makes sense, then give you the full cass-memory.ts file you can drop into a repo.

1. What this CLI does (in ACE / Claude‑Diary terms)
We’re basically wrapping Cass with a tiny, model‑agnostic “memory brain” that any coding agent can call:

Cass stays the source of episodic data

You keep indexing your sessions with cass.

This CLI never parses random log formats; it just shells out to Cass and treats it as the canonical “session DB”. 
GitHub
+1

This CLI adds two layers on top, in an ACE‑style way 
ar5iv
+1

diary command (Claude Diary analogue 
Lance's Blog
):

Input: a Cass session path.

Action:

cass export <session> --format markdown → get the conversation.

Use generateObject from the Vercel AI SDK to write a structured diary entry (status, tags, key lessons, mistakes, preferences, etc.). 
AI SDK
+1

Stores it as JSON under ~/.memory-system/diary/*.json.

Output (stdout): pure JSON with the diary data, so any agent can ingest it.

reflect command (ACE’s Generator/Reflector/Curator over diaries 
ar5iv
):

Input: a set of diaries (global or per‑workspace).

Action:

Load existing playbook bullets from ~/.memory-system/playbooks/*.jsonl.

Call generateObject again with a Zod schema describing delta updates to the playbook (add / update / deprecate bullets with helpful/harmful counters). 
ar5iv
+1

Apply those deltas deterministically in TypeScript (Curator): only update or append bullets; never rewrite everything → no context collapse or brevity bias. 
ar5iv

Track processed diary IDs in a per‑scope processed.log, so you don’t re‑reflect the same entry over and over (Claude Diary also does this). 
Lance's Blog

Output: JSON including applied deltas and a summary of the updated playbook.

Any coding agent can use it

Because it’s:

A single TS/Bun file with a shebang (#!/usr/bin/env -S bun run).

Output is always JSON to stdout; diagnostics go to stderr (mirrors Cass’s style). 
GitHub

The only external “tool” it depends on is the cass binary on $PATH.

AI calls go through the Vercel AI SDK (ai + zod) with a pluggable --model (e.g. openai/gpt-4.1-mini, anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.5, etc.). 
AI SDK
+1

You can then drop a tiny snippet into any AGENTS.md / tool config like:

# Cass episodic + playbook memory (agent-agnostic)

# Create a diary for the current session:
cass-memory diary --session /path/from/cass --workspace $PWD --agent "$AGENT_NAME"

# Periodically reflect and update the shared playbook for this repo:
cass-memory reflect --scope workspace --workspace $PWD --max-diaries 12
2. Single‑file Bun/TypeScript CLI (cass-memory.ts)
Dependencies (once per project):

bun add ai zod
Environment:

Set CASS_MEMORY_MODEL to something like openai/gpt-4.1-mini or anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.5. 
AI SDK
+1

Ensure your provider API key is available (e.g. OPENAI_API_KEY, ANTHROPIC_API_KEY), configured as required by the AI SDK / provider. 
AI SDK
+1

Save this as cass-memory.ts, chmod +x cass-memory.ts, and symlink or copy it into your $PATH as cass-memory.

cass-memory — ACE-style reflection CLI on top of Cass

Usage:
  cass-memory diary   --session <cass-session-path> [--workspace PATH] [--agent NAME] [--model MODEL] [--dry-run]
  cass-memory reflect [--scope global|workspace] [--workspace PATH] [--max-diaries N] [--model MODEL] [--include-processed]

Commands:

  diary
    - Calls \`cass export <session> --format markdown --include-tools\`.
    - Uses the Vercel AI SDK to generate a structured diary entry JSON.
    - Saves entries under ~/.memory-system/diary/*.json (unless --dry-run).
    - Always prints a JSON envelope with the diary on stdout.

  reflect
    - Loads diaries (global or workspace-scoped) and the existing playbook.
    - Uses the Vercel AI SDK to generate ACE-style deltas: add/update/deprecate bullets.
    - Applies deltas deterministically and saves the playbook as JSONL:
        ~/.memory-system/playbooks/playbook.global.jsonl
        ~/.memory-system/playbooks/playbook.ws-<hash>.jsonl
    - Tracks processed diaries in ~/.memory-system/reflections/*.log.

Environment:

  CASS_MEMORY_MODEL   Model identifier for Vercel AI SDK, e.g. "openai/gpt-4.1-mini".
                      Can be overridden with --model per command.

Notes:

  - stdout is always JSON; diagnostics and errors go to stderr.
  - This CLI assumes "cass" is installed and on your PATH.

3. How this fits your Cass + ACE + “Claude Diary” goals
Agent‑agnostic:
Nothing in the CLI cares which coding agent produced the log. Cass already normalized everything; we just take Cass session paths and optionally an --agent label if you want it in the diary metadata.

ACE‑style memory, not one‑off prompts:

Context is a playbook of bullets with helpful/harmful counters and IDs, updated via incremental deltas (add/update/deprecate), which is exactly the ACE design.

We never ask the model to rewrite the whole playbook; we only integrate deltas with deterministic JS code, which avoids context collapse and brevity bias.

Claude Diary pattern generalized:

diary == /diary command Lance describes (episodic summaries, including design decisions, mistakes, preferences). 
Lance's Blog

reflect == /reflect + ACE’s Reflector/Curator: read diary entries + current rules, propose bullet updates, and write them to a persistent file.

Works for any coding agent:

You can plug this into Claude Code, Cursor, Gemini CLI, Aider, etc., by just giving them the AGENTS‑style snippet and letting them call cass + cass-memory as shell tools. Cass already knows how to ingest all those agents’ logs.

If you’d like, next step I can:

Add a small retrieve command that returns “best bullets + 1–3 relevant diary summaries” for a given objective, so agents can pull in just‑in‑time context in one call.
