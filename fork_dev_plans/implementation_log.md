# Implementation Log

Running record of what was built, what diverged from the plan, and gotchas for future sessions.

Architecture plan: [v1_prototype_architecture.md](v1_prototype_architecture.md)

## Current Status

**Phase:** 5 — Electron App (5a/5b/5c complete, C2+C4 deferred) + Pipeline Hardening
**Last updated:** 2026-03-25

---

## Deferred: LLM Prompt Tuning (Post-Build)

All build phases use mock LLM responses in tests. The prompts are structurally complete and follow the architecture spec, but have **not been tested against a real LLM with real data**. Prompt tuning will happen as a single pass after all build phases are complete, on a machine with an API key.

**What needs tuning (by phase):**

| Phase | Prompts | File | Lines |
|-------|---------|------|-------|
| Phase 2 | `sessionNoteCreate`, `sessionNoteAppend` | `src/llm.ts` | PROMPTS object |
| Phase 3 | `diaryFromNote`, `reflectorCall1`, `reflectorCall2` | `src/llm.ts` | PROMPTS object |
| Phase 4+ | (TBD — add here as phases are built) | | |

**How to validate:**
1. Clone repo on work machine with API key set (`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`)
2. Create a few session notes from real transcripts: `bun run src/cm.ts snapshot`
3. Run reflection: `bun run src/cm.ts reflect`
4. Inspect outputs: `~/.memory-system/knowledge/*.md`, `~/.memory-system/digests/*.md`, playbook bullets
5. Iterate on prompts in `src/llm.ts` PROMPTS object until output quality is acceptable
6. Key things to watch for: knowledge sections that parrot existing pages (guardrail failure), empty/generic bullets, topic misrouting, overly verbose digests

**This is safe to defer** because:
- Agent-provided path (`cm_snapshot` via MCP) doesn't use LLM — works today
- All pipeline logic (parsing, dedup, validation, curation) is tested against mock data
- Prompt tuning is isolated to the PROMPTS object in `src/llm.ts` — no structural changes needed

## Log Entries

### [Phase 1, Step 1] Delete unused modules and clean up imports
**Date:** 2026-03-23
**Files deleted (source):** `src/trauma.ts`, `src/trauma_guard_script.ts`, `src/starters.ts`, `src/commands/guard.ts`, `src/commands/starters.ts`, `src/commands/quickstart.ts`, `src/commands/trauma.ts`
**Files deleted (test):** `test/trauma.test.ts`, `test/trauma-guard-script.test.ts`, `test/cli-trauma.e2e.test.ts`, `test/cli-guard.e2e.test.ts`, `test/starters.test.ts`, `test/cli-starters.e2e.test.ts`, `test/quickstart.test.ts`, `test/cli-quickstart.e2e.test.ts`, `test/onboard-state.test.ts`, `test/workflow-first-week.e2e.test.ts`
**Files modified (source):** `src/cm.ts` (removed 4 imports, 4 command registrations, flags), `src/commands/init.ts` (removed runTraumaScan, seedStarter, guard installation, 6 imports), `src/commands/audit.ts` (removed trauma scan mode), `src/commands/context.ts` (removed trauma Pain Injection), `src/commands/doctor.ts` (removed trauma system checks)
**Files modified (test):** `test/commands-basic.test.ts`, `test/cm.test.ts`, `test/cli-audit.e2e.test.ts`, `test/e2e-smoke.test.ts`, `test/cli-command-chains.e2e.test.ts`, `test/audit.test.ts`, `test/cli-init.e2e.test.ts`, `test/doctor-command.test.ts`
**Differs from plan:** Yes — `src/onboard-state.ts` was NOT deleted despite being in the original plan, because `src/commands/onboard.ts` imports 6 functions from it. `src/commands/trauma.ts` was added to the delete list (missing from original plan). `test/workflow-first-week.e2e.test.ts` was deleted because it depended entirely on the quickstart+starters flow.
**Gotchas encountered:**
- Deletion cascaded much further than expected: 5 source files had imports from deleted modules (init.ts, audit.ts, context.ts, doctor.ts, cm.ts)
- `src/commands/doctor.ts` was missed initially → caused 128 E2E test failures (import-time crash)
- `onboard-state.ts` must stay — onboard.ts depends on it heavily
- `--starter` flag in cm.ts init command was still registered after starters.ts deletion
**Open questions:** None

### [Phase 1, Step 2] Rename paths (~/.cass-memory → ~/.memory-system)
**Date:** 2026-03-23
**Files changed:** 53 files across `src/` and `test/`, plus docs and `.cass/playbook.yaml`
**Differs from plan:** No
**Gotchas encountered:**
- Bulk sed replace was safe because `.cass-memory` pattern only appears as the dotfile directory name, never as a substring of something else
- Variable names like `cassMemoryDir` were left as-is (internal identifiers, not user-facing paths)
**Open questions:** None

### [Phase 1, Step 3] Add new Zod types and update ConfigSchema
**Date:** 2026-03-23
**Files changed:** `src/types.ts`
**New types added:** `TopicSchema`, `TopicsFileSchema`, `SessionNoteSchema`, `KnowledgePageSchema`, `DailyDigestSchema`, `UserNoteSchema`, `TopicSuggestionSchema`, `KnowledgePageAppendDeltaSchema`, `DigestUpdateDeltaSchema`, `TopicSuggestionDeltaSchema`, `KnowledgeDeltaSchema` (discriminated union), `SessionProcessingStateSchema`, `ProcessingStateSchema`
**New enums:** `ConfidenceTierEnum`, `TopicSourceEnum`
**ConfigSchema additions:** `sessionNotesDir`, `knowledgeDir`, `digestsDir`, `notesDir`, `searchDbPath`, `stateJsonPath`, `topicsJsonPath`, `periodicJobIntervalHours`, `knowledgePageBloatThreshold`, `staleTopicIgnoreDays`, `transcriptRetentionDays`
**Differs from plan:** No
**Gotchas encountered:** None — existing 68 type tests all pass unchanged
**Open questions:** None

### [Phase 1, Step 4] Implement search.ts and update directory structure
**Date:** 2026-03-23
**Files created:** `src/search.ts`, `test/search.test.ts`
**Files changed:** `src/utils.ts` (added `session-notes`, `knowledge`, `digests`, `notes` to `ensureGlobalStructure()`)
**Differs from plan:** Used `bun:sqlite` (built-in) instead of `better-sqlite3` (external package). Zero-dep, FTS5 supported natively.
**Implementation details:**
- `SearchIndex` class wraps bun:sqlite with typed methods for each content type
- Schema: `sessions` table, `session_topics` join table, 5 FTS5 virtual tables (knowledge, sessions, transcripts, notes, digests), `meta` table for version tracking
- WAL mode enabled for concurrent read safety with Electron app
- Porter stemming + unicode61 tokenizer for FTS5
- `openSearchIndex()` convenience factory
- 19 unit tests covering: schema creation, session CRUD, FTS indexing for all 5 content types, cross-table search, limits, edge cases, lifecycle
**Gotchas encountered:** None
**Open questions:** None

### [Phase 1, Step 5] Fix config defaults per architecture plan
**Date:** 2026-03-23
**Files changed:** `src/types.ts`, `test/config.test.ts`, `test/cli-usage.e2e.test.ts`, `test/cli-similar.e2e.test.ts`, `test/commands-basic.test.ts`, `test/helpers/factories.ts`, `test/fixtures/config-default.json`
**Changes:**
- Budget defaults: `dailyLimit` 0.10 → 0.50, `monthlyLimit` 2.00 → 10.00 (architecture plan specifies higher limits for two-call Reflector pipeline)
- `semanticSearchEnabled` default: `false` → `true` (architecture plan specifies semantic search on by default)
- Updated all test assertions and fixtures that hardcoded old default values
**Differs from plan:** No — these were oversights in Step 3 caught during manual verification
**Gotchas encountered:**
- Budget default changes cascaded into ~20 test assertions across config.test.ts and cli-usage.e2e.test.ts (the sed replace missed `.toBe(0.10)` patterns)
- semanticSearchEnabled change broke 3 cli-similar tests and 1 commands-basic test that assumed keyword mode — fixed by explicitly setting `semanticSearchEnabled: false` in those tests (they're testing keyword-mode behavior)
**Open questions:** None

---

## Phase 1 Validation Summary

**Test results:** 2331 pass, 46 fail (all pre-existing serve-stats.test.ts), 3 skip
**Baseline before Phase 1:** 2505 pass, 46 fail
**Delta:** -174 pass (removed tests for deleted modules), +19 pass (new search tests)
**No regressions introduced.**

---

## Phase 2: Session Note Generation

### [Phase 2, Step 1] Create session-notes.ts core module
**Date:** 2026-03-23
**Files created:** `src/session-notes.ts`, `src/commands/snapshot.ts`, `test/session-notes.test.ts`, `scripts/pre-compact-snapshot.sh`
**Files modified:** `src/llm.ts` (added `sessionNoteCreate` + `sessionNoteAppend` prompts, `generateSessionNoteContent()` + `extendSessionNoteContent()` functions), `src/commands/serve.ts` (added `cm_snapshot` MCP tool definition + handler), `src/cm.ts` (added `snapshot` CLI command)
**Differs from plan:** No major deviations. Used `generateObjectSafe` with a structured output schema (`{ abstract, topics_touched, content }`) instead of `generateText`, since the existing LLM infrastructure supports this and it gives us Zod validation on the output. Added a PreCompact hook script to auto-trigger snapshots before context compaction (not in original Phase 2 scope, but a natural extension discussed during planning).
**Implementation details:**
- **`src/session-notes.ts`** (~370 lines): Complete session note lifecycle — transcript discovery (`discoverTranscripts()`), offset-based scanning (`scanForModifiedTranscripts()`), byte-level transcript reading (`readTranscriptFromOffset()`), note creation/extension via LLM, YAML frontmatter parsing/serialization, state.json management, FTS indexing integration, `user_edited` skip logic
- **`src/commands/snapshot.ts`** (~105 lines): CLI command wrapping `processTranscript`/`processAllTranscripts` with JSON/human output
- **`src/llm.ts`** additions: Two new prompts following the Session Note Generator Specification from the architecture plan (inclusion/exclusion criteria, topic transition headers, append coherence rules, invalidation detection). Two new exported functions that use `generateObjectSafe` with retry + budget tracking
- **`src/commands/serve.ts`** additions: `cm_snapshot` MCP tool with optional session targeting and batch processing
- **`scripts/pre-compact-snapshot.sh`**: Background-launched hook script for Claude Code's `PreCompact` event
- **Transcript discovery**: Scans `~/.claude/projects/*/` for `.jsonl` files. Tested against real data: found 117 transcripts across all projects
- **24 unit tests** covering: session ID generation, frontmatter parse/serialize roundtrip, processing state CRUD, transcript discovery, offset-based scanning, offset-based reading, JSONL formatting, full processTranscript flow (create, extend, user_edited skip) with mock LLM
**Gotchas encountered:**
- `bun run -e` syntax doesn't work; need `bun --eval` for inline TypeScript evaluation
- `formatRawSession()` from diary.ts handles the JSONL→readable text conversion well but some Claude Code message types (queue-operation, file-history-snapshot, ai-title) produce no output — this is correct behavior since they're metadata, not conversation content
- Circular import potential: session-notes.ts imports from llm.ts, and llm.ts imports schemas from session-notes.ts. Resolved cleanly because the schemas are just Zod objects (no runtime dependencies on session-notes functions)
**Open questions:**
- Prompt quality iteration needs real LLM testing (requires API key). The prompt follows the architecture spec closely but may need tuning after seeing actual output on real transcripts.
- PreCompact hook not yet installed in user's settings.json — ready to add when user confirms.

---

### [Phase 2, Step 2] Dual-path content generation (agent-provided vs LLM)
**Date:** 2026-03-23
**Files modified:** `src/session-notes.ts` (added `agentContent` option to `GenerateNoteOptions` and `processTranscript`), `src/commands/serve.ts` (added `abstract`, `topics`, `content` parameters to `cm_snapshot` tool), `src/commands/snapshot.ts` (added `--abstract`, `--topics`, `--content` CLI flags), `src/cm.ts` (updated snapshot command option definitions), `test/session-notes.test.ts` (+2 tests)
**Differs from plan:** Yes — the architecture plan assumed all session note generation would go through a separate LLM call. We added a second path where the calling agent (Claude Code) provides the note content directly. This was motivated by the user having a Claude Max subscription (no API key for external calls). The agent-provided path is actually higher quality since the agent has synthesized context, not just raw transcript.
**Design:**
- `processTranscript()` accepts optional `agentContent: { abstract, topics_touched, content }`. When provided, skips the LLM call entirely and writes the content directly.
- `cm_snapshot` MCP tool accepts `abstract`, `topics`, and `content` parameters. When `abstract` + `content` are both provided, agent-provided path is used. Otherwise falls back to LLM.
- CLI `snapshot` command accepts `--abstract`, `--topics`, `--content` flags for the same purpose.
- Both paths share the same file writing, state tracking, and FTS indexing logic.
- Verified working end-to-end: `cm snapshot --abstract "..." --content "..." --json` writes a session note to disk, updates state.json, no API key needed.
**Gotchas encountered:**
- CLI `--content` receives literal `\n` characters (shell doesn't expand them in flag values). In MCP usage, content has real newlines. Not a problem in practice since MCP is the primary path.
**Open questions:** None

### [Phase 2, Step 3] PreCompact hook, transcript formatter, and architecture decisions
**Date:** 2026-03-23
**Files modified:** `scripts/pre-compact-snapshot.sh` (reads stdin JSON for session_id, removed `--raw`), `src/session-notes.ts` (replaced `formatRawSession` with custom `formatTranscriptChunk`, added `--raw` flag + `extractRawMetadata` + `extractAbstractFromJsonl` — kept as fallback but not used in normal flow), `src/commands/snapshot.ts` (added `--raw` option passthrough), `src/cm.ts` (added `--raw` flag to snapshot command), `src/commands/serve.ts` (strengthened `cm_snapshot` MCP tool description), `README.md` (added full setup instructions for MCP tool + PreCompact hook)
**Differs from plan:** Yes — several architecture decisions made during this step:
1. **Dropped raw transcript dumps as a primary path.** Originally built `--raw` mode for Claude Max users without API keys. After analysis, raw dumps were too noisy (89% of entries were meta noise or lost tool calls). Decided to require API key (Sonnet, ~$4/month) for the async pipeline. Raw mode kept in code as a true last-resort fallback but not used in normal flow.
2. **Two-mechanism capture with offset-based dedup.** Agent calls `cm_snapshot` via MCP (primary, no API cost) → PreCompact hook uses LLM fallback (safety net, uses API key). Both update the same byte offset in `state.json`, so if MCP already captured the session, the hook is a no-op.
3. **Custom transcript formatter.** Replaced upstream `formatRawSession` (from diary.ts) with session-note-specific `formatTranscriptChunk` that: drops meta entries (queue-operation, progress, file-history-snapshot), summarizes tool_use as one-liners (`> Read: .../file.ts`, `> Bash: npm test`), drops tool_result contents, keeps user text + assistant text + thinking blocks (truncated to 500 chars). Reduced note sizes by 78-93% (e.g. 380KB → 28KB for a medium session).
4. **Strong CLAUDE.md instruction for MCP tool.** Added a recommended CLAUDE.md block with MANDATORY heading, MUST language, and explicit trigger points (before compaction, end of major task, before commit/PR, when user wraps up).

**Implementation details:**
- PreCompact hook reads `session_id` from stdin JSON (Claude Code provides this), passes `--session <id>` to target the exact session being compacted
- `extractAbstractFromJsonl`: chunked file reader (256KB chunks) that scans JSONL for first substantive user message, handles multi-MB base64 image entries without loading them into memory, strips XML tags (ide_selection, system-reminder, etc.)
- `formatTranscriptChunk` tool summarizer handles: Read, Write, Edit, Bash (uses description field), Grep, Glob, TodoWrite (summarizes items), Agent (shows subagent type + description), Skill, ToolSearch, plus a generic fallback for unknown tools
- `shortenPath` helper keeps last 3 path segments for readability (`.../src/commands/serve.ts`)

**E2E test results (real transcripts):**
- Tested across 4 projects, 6 transcripts (0KB to 51MB), all sizes and edge cases
- Offset-based append verified: 2nd run on same session reads only delta bytes
- Agent-provided path verified: create + extend, topics merged, abstract updated
- user_edited flag respected: note body untouched, only offset updated
- Hook stdin simulation verified: piped mock PreCompact JSON → note created correctly
- Dedup verified: MCP call → hook fires → "No modified transcript found" (no-op)

**Gotchas encountered:**
- `formatRawSession` from diary.ts treats all JSONL entry types equally — tool_use blocks become `[empty]`, tool_result blocks dump raw file contents, meta entries produce noise. This was the main motivation for the custom formatter.
- Base64 images in JSONL can be 1-5MB per line. Initial 50KB read buffer for abstract extraction was too small — switched to 256KB chunked reader with pre-filter (`line.includes('"type":"user"')`) to skip non-user entries without parsing.
- Claude Code user messages often start with XML tags (ide_selection, ide_opened_file) that need stripping before extracting the actual user text.

**Open questions:**
- **LLM summarization path not yet validated with a real API key.** The prompts in `llm.ts` (`sessionNoteCreate`, `sessionNoteAppend`) follow the architecture spec but have not been tested against Sonnet with real transcript input. This must be validated before Phase 2 can be considered fully complete. Prompt tuning may be needed after seeing actual output.

---

## Phase 2 Validation Summary

**Test results:** 2356 pass, 47 fail (46 pre-existing serve module + 1 flaky performance test), 3 skip
**Baseline before Phase 2:** 2331 pass, 46 fail
**Delta:** +26 pass (new session-notes tests), +1 fail (flaky performance.e2e.test — not from our changes)
**No regressions introduced.**

**Phase 2 status:** Functionally complete pending LLM path validation with real API key.

---

### [Phase 2, Step 4] Global configuration and slash commands
**Date:** 2026-03-23
**Files created:** `~/.claude/.mcp.json` (global MCP server config), `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` (global session note instruction), `~/.claude/commands/snapshot.md` (`/snapshot` slash command)
**Files modified:** `README.md` (updated setup instructions from per-project to global-first)
**Differs from plan:** Not in the original Phase 2 scope, but necessary for the capture pipeline to work across all projects. Previously the MCP server and CLAUDE.md instruction were only per-project — moved to global `~/.claude/` so session notes are captured in every session regardless of working directory.
**Key decisions:**
1. **Global over per-project config.** MCP server at `~/.claude/.mcp.json` and instructions at `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` work in all projects. Per-project setup remains as a documented fallback.
2. **Removed premature `/context` command.** The existing `cm_context` serves old playbook/CASS data. Proper context retrieval (FTS + knowledge pages) is Phase 4 work. Added `/snapshot` only.
3. **Main agent writes notes, not a separate agent.** The agent in conversation has full context and produces higher quality notes than a separate agent reconstructing from transcript. PreCompact hook remains as LLM safety net for missed sessions.
**Gotchas encountered:**
- Slash commands in Claude Code run inside the current conversation with full chat context — they're prompt templates expanded in-place, not separate processes
- MCP server config requires a session restart to take effect (Claude Code loads MCP servers at session start)
- `/context` would have called the old CASS retrieval system, which returns stale data irrelevant to the new pipeline — deferred to Phase 4
**Open questions:**
- MCP tool compliance: Does the CLAUDE.md instruction reliably trigger proactive `cm_snapshot` calls? Needs real-world testing across multiple sessions.

---

## Phase 3: Reflection Pipeline

### [Phase 3, Step 1] Types — Reflector output schemas
**Date:** 2026-03-23
**Files changed:** `src/types.ts`
**New schemas:** `ReflectorCall1OutputSchema`, `ReflectorCall2OutputSchema`, `DiaryFromNoteOutputSchema`, `ReflectorQualityTelemetrySchema`, `KnowledgePageSectionSchema`, `ParsedKnowledgePageSchema`
**Differs from plan:** No
**Gotchas encountered:** None — all 68 existing type tests pass unchanged
**Open questions:** None

### [Phase 3, Step 2] Diary-from-note + LLM prompts
**Date:** 2026-03-23
**Files changed:** `src/diary.ts` (added `generateDiaryFromNote()`), `src/llm.ts` (added `diaryFromNote`, `reflectorCall1`, `reflectorCall2` prompts + `extractDiaryFromNote()`, `runReflectorCall1()`, `runReflectorCall2()` functions)
**Differs from plan:** No. Used existing `generateObjectSafe` + `llmWithRetry` pattern. Prompts follow Option C (focused, no examples) from collaborative review with user.
**Gotchas encountered:** None
**Open questions:** Prompts need real LLM validation (same as Phase 2 — requires API key)

### [Phase 3, Step 3] Two-call Reflector in reflect.ts
**Date:** 2026-03-23
**Files changed:** `src/reflect.ts` (added `TwoCallReflectionResult`, `formatTopicsForPrompt()`, `reflectOnSessionTwoCalls()`)
**Differs from plan:** No. Call 1 and Call 2 fail independently. Call 2 merges Call 1's proposed topics into available list in-memory. Cold start adds `general` catch-all topic.
**Gotchas encountered:**
- `related_bullet_indices` from Call 2 resolved to provisional `pending-N` references since actual bullet IDs are assigned by Curator later
**Open questions:** None

### [Phase 3, Step 4] Three-source Validator
**Date:** 2026-03-23
**Files changed:** `src/validate.ts` (added `evidenceCountGateFromNotes()`, `validateKnowledgeDelta()`, `upgradeConfidence()`)
**Differs from plan:** No. Three sources: session note bodies (pattern matching), SQLite FTS transcripts (keyword search), source count heuristic. Confidence only upgrades, never downgrades.
**Gotchas encountered:**
- `openSearchIndex()` may fail if search.db doesn't exist yet — wrapped in try/catch to gracefully skip source 3
**Open questions:** None

### [Phase 3, Step 5] Curator + knowledge page I/O
**Date:** 2026-03-23
**Files created:** `src/knowledge-page.ts`
**Files changed:** `src/curate.ts` (added `curateKnowledge()` handling 3 delta types)
**Implementation details:**
- `knowledge-page.ts`: parseKnowledgePage with 3-line lookahead for HTML comment metadata, serializeKnowledgePage for roundtrip, loadKnowledgePage/writeKnowledgePage with locking + atomic write, appendSectionToPage with source-session-ID dedup, topics.json CRUD, digest file append
- `curate.ts`: `curateKnowledge()` is fully deterministic (no LLM). Handles `knowledge_page_append` (delegates to appendSectionToPage), `digest_update` (delegates to appendToDigest), `topic_suggestion` (delegates to addTopicSuggestion)
**Differs from plan:** No
**Gotchas encountered:**
- HTML comment metadata format: `<!-- id: X | confidence: Y | source: Z | added: D | related_bullets: B -->`. Parser uses 3-line lookahead after `## Heading` to find metadata comments (handles blank lines between heading and comment)
- Dedup key is source session ID, not semantic similarity (per architecture plan)
**Open questions:** None

### [Phase 3, Step 6] Orchestrator wiring
**Date:** 2026-03-23
**Files changed:** `src/orchestrator.ts` (extended `ReflectionOutcome`, added Phase 3 knowledge reflection pipeline after existing playbook pipeline), `src/session-notes.ts` (added `findUnprocessedSessionNotes()`, `markSessionNoteProcessed()`)
**Pipeline flow:** find unprocessed notes → per-note: diary from note → load knowledge pages → two-call reflect → validate both delta types → curate knowledge → re-index SQLite → mark processed
**Differs from plan:** No — used Modified Option A (in-place with surgical seams) as decided during planning
**Gotchas encountered:** None — all 7 existing orchestrator tests pass unchanged
**Open questions:** None

### [Phase 3, Step 7] Tests
**Date:** 2026-03-23
**Files created:** `test/phase3-reflect.test.ts` (10 tests), `test/phase3-validate.test.ts` (14 tests), `test/knowledge-page.test.ts` (17 tests)
**Differs from plan:** No
**Gotchas encountered:**
- Mock LLMIO detection: `JSON.stringify(zodSchema)` does not produce readable field names. Fixed by using a call counter to distinguish Call 1 from Call 2 invocations.
- "Call 1 failure" test: `generateObjectSafe` retries up to 3 times before propagating the error, so the mock needed to throw on calls 1-3 (not just call 1) for the error to reach reflectOnSessionTwoCalls's catch block.
**Open questions:** None

---

## Phase 3 Validation Summary

**Test results:** 2383 pass, 47 fail (all pre-existing serve module), 3 skip
**Baseline before Phase 3:** 2356 pass, 47 fail
**Delta:** +41 pass (10 reflect + 14 validate + 17 knowledge-page), +0 fail
**New test files:** `test/phase3-reflect.test.ts`, `test/phase3-validate.test.ts`, `test/knowledge-page.test.ts`
**No regressions introduced.**

**Phase 3 status:** Functionally complete pending LLM validation with real API key.

---

### [Phase 4] Context Retrieval + Topic System — Complete Build
**Date:** 2026-03-24
**Files changed:**
- `src/types.ts` — Added KnowledgeSearchHitSchema, TopicExcerptSchema, RecentSessionSchema, RelatedTopicSchema, ReviewQueueItemSchema (discriminated union), ReviewQueueSchema. Extended ContextResultSchema (renamed historySnippets→searchResults, added Phase 4 optional fields). Extended ProcessingStateSchema (lastPeriodicJobRun, lastIndexUpdate).
- `src/commands/context.ts` — Core rewrite: replaced cass binary search with SQLite FTS via searchKnowledgeBase(), added topic excerpt assembly, related topics by semantic similarity, unprocessed session notes, suggested deep dives, lastReflectionRun. Updated CLI formatters.
- `src/review-queue.ts` — NEW: loadReviewQueue, saveReviewQueue, appendReviewItems (dedup by composite key), dismissReviewItem, approveReviewItem.
- `src/knowledge-page.ts` — Added addTopic, removeTopic, listTopicsWithMetadata, coldStartTopic (embeds description, searches existing knowledge).
- `src/commands/topic.ts` — NEW: CLI for topic add/list/remove.
- `src/cm.ts` — Registered topic command, added --full flag to reflect command.
- `src/orchestrator.ts` — Extended re-indexing to include session notes + digests + lastIndexUpdate timestamp.
- `src/periodic-job.ts` — NEW: lock (tryAcquire/release with stale detection >15min), timer (shouldRunPeriodicJob), full pipeline (runPeriodicJob), background trigger (maybeRunPeriodicJobBackground).
- `src/commands/mcp-stdio.ts` — Wired periodic job background trigger at MCP server start.
- `src/commands/serve.ts` — Added cm_detail tool (path traversal security, section extraction), cm_search tool (FTS + playbook search, scope filtering, transcript 0.5x ranking), updated cm_context/cm_feedback descriptions. Added 5 MCP resources (cm://topics, cm://knowledge/{topic}, cm://digest/{date}, cm://today, cm://status). Restructured handleResourceRead to prefix-based matching.
- `src/commands/reflect.ts` — Added --full flag invoking runPeriodicJob().
- `src/utils.ts` — Mechanical rename: historySnippets→searchResults.
- `test/phase4-context.test.ts` — NEW: 15 tests for extended context retrieval.
- `test/phase4-search.test.ts` — NEW: 29 tests for cm_search and cm_detail MCP tools.
- `test/phase4-topics.test.ts` — NEW: 12 tests for topic CRUD and review queue.
- `test/phase4-periodic-job.test.ts` — NEW: 7 tests for lock, timer, state.
- Various test files — Mechanical renames (historySnippets→searchResults, HISTORY→KNOWLEDGE).

**Differs from plan:** Minor differences:
1. `memory_search` kept as full deprecated alias (still routes to legacy cass search) rather than delegating to cm_search, for backward compatibility.
2. cm_detail returns structured section metadata (id, confidence, source, added) rather than a generic metadata object.
3. cm://today returns a "No digest found" message instead of erroring when no digest exists.

**Gotchas encountered:**
- `loadKnowledgePage()` returns `ParsedKnowledgePage | null`, not a raw string — need `serializeKnowledgePage()` for cm://knowledge resource.
- KnowledgePageSection has `content` field, not `body` — caught during test writing.
- Playbook schema_version is `2` (number), not `"1.0"` (string). Tests using raw YAML must match this or use the factory.
- `historySnippets` rename touched ~7 source and test files. All mechanical.
- Pre-existing test failures (47→46 fail): one pre-existing failure was fixed incidentally.

**Open questions:** None.

## Phase 4 Validation Summary

**Test results:** 2461 pass, 46 fail (pre-existing serve module), 3 skip
**Baseline before Phase 4:** 2397 pass, 47 fail
**Delta:** +64 pass (15 context + 29 search + 12 topics + 7 periodic-job + 1 pre-existing fix), -1 fail
**New test files:** `test/phase4-context.test.ts`, `test/phase4-search.test.ts`, `test/phase4-topics.test.ts`, `test/phase4-periodic-job.test.ts`
**No regressions introduced.**

**Phase 4 status:** Functionally complete. All 10 build steps implemented.

## Phase 5: Electron App

### [Phase 5, Pre-work] Backend additions for Electron
**Date:** 2026-03-24
**Files created:** `src/user-notes.ts`, `src/starred.ts`
**Files modified:** `src/types.ts` (added `UserFlagItemSchema`), `src/review-queue.ts` (added `flagContent()`, updated `compositeKey()`)
**Differs from plan:** No.
**Implementation details:**
- `src/user-notes.ts`: Full CRUD — createUserNote, loadUserNote, saveUserNote, deleteUserNote, listUserNotes. YAML frontmatter + markdown body, withLock + atomicWrite. IDs: `note-{timestamp36}-{random6}`.
- `src/starred.ts`: Separate `~/.memory-system/starred.json` index (not frontmatter). starItem/unstarItem/isStarred/loadStarred. Dedup by composite `path::section` key.
- `UserFlagItemSchema`: Added to ReviewQueueItemSchema discriminated union. Fields: type "user_flag", target_path, target_section?, reason?, target_topic (default "").
- `flagContent()`: Creates user_flag item, appends via appendReviewItems with dedup.
**Gotchas encountered:** None.
**Open questions:** None.

### [Phase 5a] Electron App — Core Browse + Search + Edit
**Date:** 2026-03-24
**Files created (35+ new):**
- `electron/package.json`, `electron/tsconfig.json`, `electron/tsconfig.node.json`, `electron/electron.vite.config.ts`
- `electron/src/main/index.ts` — App lifecycle, BrowserWindow, security (contextIsolation: true, nodeIntegration: false)
- `electron/src/main/ipc-handlers.ts` — 20 IPC handlers
- `electron/src/main/file-reader.ts` — 12 reader functions + ported frontmatter/knowledge page parsers
- `electron/src/main/search.ts` — better-sqlite3 readonly FTS5 search across 5 tables
- `electron/src/main/cli-bridge.ts` — `bun run src/cm.ts ... --json` for topic/reflect operations
- `electron/src/main/file-ops.ts` — Direct file mutations for review queue, starred, user notes
- `electron/src/main/watcher.ts` — chokidar with 500ms debounce, ignores lock/cache/tmp
- `electron/src/main/types.ts` — Display-oriented TypeScript interfaces
- `electron/src/preload/index.ts` — contextBridge with ~25 typed methods
- `electron/src/renderer/main.tsx` — React 19 + TanStack Query (staleTime: 10s)
- `electron/src/renderer/App.tsx` — Full layout: search bar, sidebar, content router, status bar
- `electron/src/renderer/stores/ui-store.ts` — Zustand
- `electron/src/renderer/hooks/` — 7 TanStack Query hooks
- `electron/src/renderer/components/layout/` — SearchBar, Sidebar, StatusBar
- `electron/src/renderer/components/sidebar/` — EncyclopediaTab, RecentTab
- `electron/src/renderer/components/content/` — MarkdownRenderer, KnowledgePage, SessionNote, DigestView, Editor
- `electron/src/renderer/lib/formatters.ts` — Date/time formatting utilities
- `electron/src/renderer/styles/global.css` — Full "Archival Precision" design system

**Differs from plan:** No major deviations.
1. `better-sqlite3` search opens db in readonly mode (plan didn't specify).
2. CLI bridge resolves repo root relative to __dirname (more portable than hardcoded path).
3. File-ops module added for direct mutations (review queue, starred, user notes) — plan assumed CLI for all writes, but these are simple JSON/markdown ops that don't need the pipeline.

**Gotchas encountered:**
- better-sqlite3 native compilation on macOS requires `SDKROOT=$(xcrun --show-sdk-path) LDFLAGS="-L$(xcrun --show-sdk-path)/usr/lib" npm install` when Xcode CLT and Xcode.app have mismatched SDK paths. Standard `npm install` fails with "stdio.h not found" then "library 'c++' not found".
- electron-vite build must run from the `electron/` directory, not the repo root.
- Google Fonts import in CSS works in dev but may need inlining for production/offline use.

**Open questions:** None.

### [Phase 5b] Electron App — User Actions + Review Queue
**Date:** 2026-03-24
**Files created:**
- `electron/src/renderer/components/actions/ActionToolbar.tsx` — Hover toolbar: verify (rewrites confidence metadata), invalidate (opens dialog), flag (opens dialog), star (toggles)
- `electron/src/renderer/components/actions/InvalidateDialog.tsx` — Modal with reason text, wraps section in [INVALIDATED] annotation
- `electron/src/renderer/components/actions/FlagDialog.tsx` — Modal with optional reason, calls flagContent IPC
- `electron/src/renderer/components/sidebar/ReviewQueueTab.tsx` — Pending items list + useReviewCount() for badge
- `electron/src/renderer/components/sidebar/StarredTab.tsx` — Starred items with unstar + navigate
- `electron/src/renderer/components/sidebar/MyNotesTab.tsx` — User notes list + "+ New Note"
- `electron/src/renderer/components/content/ReviewQueue.tsx` — Grouped by type, approve/dismiss actions
- `electron/src/renderer/components/content/UserNote.tsx` — Inline title editing, delete confirmation
- `electron/src/renderer/hooks/use-review-queue.ts`, `use-starred.ts`, `use-user-notes.ts`

**Files modified:**
- `electron/src/renderer/stores/ui-store.ts` — Extended SidebarTab (5 tabs), ContentView (7 types), added dialog state
- `electron/src/renderer/components/layout/Sidebar.tsx` — 5 tabs, review badge count
- `electron/src/renderer/components/content/KnowledgePage.tsx` — ActionToolbar on section hover
- `electron/src/renderer/App.tsx` — Routes user-note + review-queue, renders dialogs at root
- `electron/src/renderer/styles/global.css` — +8KB for action toolbar, dialog/modal, review queue, user notes, sidebar badge

**Differs from plan:** B6 (Undo UI) deferred — undo.ts only handles playbook bullets, not knowledge base rollback. The plan's "last reflection timestamp + undo button" is in the StatusBar already (last reflection time + Run Reflection button). Full undo will need a new snapshot mechanism.

**Gotchas encountered:** None.

**Open questions:** None.

### [Phase 5c] Electron App — Claude Dialog + Polish
**Date:** 2026-03-24
**Files created:**
- `electron/src/main/claude.ts` — Anthropic API integration: conversation state management, 2 locally-fulfilled tools (search_knowledge_base via better-sqlite3, read_document via file-reader), agentic loop handling multi-turn tool_use (max 5 iterations), system prompt with optional document context from current view.
- `electron/src/renderer/components/claude/ClaudeDialog.tsx` — Collapsible panel (Cmd+J toggle), claudeAvailable() check on mount, chat history with markdown rendering (reuses MarkdownRenderer), tool usage badges, thinking dot animation, textarea input with Enter-to-send/Shift+Enter for newline, reset conversation button.

**Files modified:**
- `electron/src/main/ipc-handlers.ts` — Added 3 IPC handlers: claude-available, claude-send, claude-reset. Added import from claude.ts.
- `electron/src/preload/index.ts` — Exposed claudeAvailable(), claudeSend(message, documentContext?), claudeReset() via contextBridge.
- `electron/src/renderer/App.tsx` — Added ClaudeDialog between content and status bar.
- `electron/src/renderer/components/layout/StatusBar.tsx` — Added animated progress bar (2px amber sweep) visible when isReflecting is true.
- `electron/src/renderer/styles/global.css` — Updated grid layout to 4 rows (added claude area). Added ~200 lines: Claude panel (toggle, body, messages, input), message bubbles (user right-aligned/assistant left-aligned), tool badges, thinking dots animation, progress bar sweep animation.
- `electron/package.json` — Added `@anthropic-ai/sdk` dependency.

**Differs from plan:**
1. C2 (Related Topics panel) deferred — requires semantic.ts integration or embedding cache reads, lower priority than core functionality.
2. C4 (Packaging) deferred — electron-builder config for distribution, not needed for personal use.
3. Claude dialog uses `claude-sonnet-4-20250514` model (hardcoded) — could be made configurable.

**Gotchas encountered:**
- The Anthropic SDK is imported in the main process (Node.js), not the renderer. This is correct — API keys should never be in the renderer process.
- Tool fulfillment happens locally in the main process: search_knowledge_base calls the same better-sqlite3 search function, read_document calls the same file-reader functions. No additional IPC roundtrip needed.
- Grid layout changed from 3 rows to 4 rows to accommodate the Claude panel. The panel collapses to just the toggle bar (~28px) when closed.

**Open questions:** None.

## Phase 5 Validation Summary

**Test results:** 2461 pass, 46 fail (pre-existing), 3 skip — unchanged from Phase 4.
**Electron app is a separate build** — does not affect bun test suite.
**Build outputs:** main (31KB), preload (2.8KB), renderer (1.4MB), CSS (37KB).
**Phase 5 status:** 5a/5b/5c functionally complete. C2 (Related Topics) and C4 (Packaging) deferred. Pending manual testing with real data.

## Pipeline Hardening (Post-Phase 5)

### Knowledge Architecture Redesign
**Date:** 2026-03-25
**Files changed:**
- `src/types.ts` — Added SubPageSchema, subpages[] to TopicSchema, sub_page to KnowledgePageAppendDeltaSchema and ReflectorCall2OutputSchema, .default([]) on bullets and topic_suggestions arrays, TopicSuggestionItemSchema for review queue
- `src/knowledge-page.ts` — Full rewrite for directory model: topicDirPath(), subPagePath(), createTopicDirectory(), addSubPage(), listSubPages(). loadKnowledgePage/writeKnowledgePage accept optional subPage param. appendSectionToPage requires topic to exist (rejects undefined). addTopicSuggestion routes to review queue instead of auto-creating. listTopicsWithMetadata aggregates across sub-pages.
- `src/knowledge-gen.ts` — Rewritten: gathers ALL relevant content ranked by score (FTS first, then notes), fills 80K char budget with per-item 40K cap, stop word filtering, FTS indexing after writing.
- `src/reflect.ts` — formatTopicsForPrompt includes sub-pages with descriptions. Call 2 only targets existing topics (removed suggested topic merging). Null-safe access on bullets/topic_suggestions.
- `src/llm.ts` — Prompt fixes: bullet kind enum values corrected (project_convention/stack_pattern/workflow_rule/anti_pattern), topic suggestion prompt rebalanced. Added configForStep() + PipelineStep type for per-step model overrides.
- `src/curate.ts` — No code changes needed (appendSectionToPage already handles filtering).
- `src/orchestrator.ts` — Removed early returns blocking Phase 3. Re-indexing supports directory model. Hoisted autoOutcome variable.
- `src/session-notes.ts` — processed flag only reset on substantial new content (>500 chars). LLM input capped at 30K chars. Raw path note body capped at 30K chars.
- `src/review-queue.ts` — compositeKey handles topic_suggestion and user_flag types. approveReviewItem returns { topicSlug? }.
- `src/cost.ts` — Added claude-haiku-4-5-20251001 pricing.
- `src/cm.ts` — Registered topic generate and add-subpage subcommands.
- `src/commands/topic.ts` — Added generate and add-subpage subcommands.

**Electron changes:**
- `electron/src/main/cli-bridge.ts` — spawn→execFile with 10MB maxBuffer (fixes 65KB stdout truncation). Added cliGenerateTopicKnowledge.
- `electron/src/main/file-ops.ts` — Topic deletion (removes from topics.json + deletes directory). approveReviewItem creates topic + fires background knowledge generation. addSubPage. User note indexing on create/save.
- `electron/src/main/search.ts` — Opened in readwrite mode (was readonly). Added indexNote() for user note FTS.
- `electron/src/main/settings.ts` — NEW: API key + budget management persisted to config.json.
- `electron/src/main/file-reader.ts` — readTopics/readKnowledgePage handle directory model. readSubPages() added.
- `electron/src/main/ipc-handlers.ts` — Added: delete-topic, generate-topic-knowledge, add-sub-page, settings IPC, budget IPC.
- `electron/src/preload/index.ts` — Exposed all new IPC methods.
- UI: icon-based sidebar tabs, resizable sidebar (DOM-direct during drag), star buttons, sub-page navigation pills, add topic/sub-page forms, topic delete button, settings page (API key + budget), search/reflection error messages surfaced.

**Key design decisions:**
- Topics are user-driven: system suggestions go to review queue, not auto-created
- Knowledge pages only generated for approved topics via generateKnowledgePage (search-based, not re-reflection)
- Per-step model config: Haiku for extractive tasks (diary, Call 1, session notes), Sonnet for generative (Call 2, knowledge gen). Side-by-side comparison showed identical quality, ~3x cost savings.
- Raw transcript FTS indexing deliberately skipped: raw transcripts are noisy and partial indexing gives false confidence. Session notes are the search layer.
- Session note backfill from old transcripts creates oversized notes (838KB). Future: installedAt timestamp to skip old transcripts, transcript browser for manual generation.

**Gotchas encountered:**
- CLI bridge stdout truncation at 65KB (pipe buffer limit) — fixed with execFile + 10MB maxBuffer
- Haiku schema compliance: follows prompt text more literally than Sonnet. Prompt/schema enum mismatches that Sonnet tolerated caused Haiku validation failures.
- processAllTranscripts defaults to maxSessions: 10 — only 8 of 118 transcripts got session notes
- FTS index not rebuilt after directory model migration — had to manually re-index
- Knowledge generation: generic search terms ("patterns", "architecture") match everything — added stop word filtering

**Open questions:** None.

## Pipeline Hardening Validation

**Test results:** 2461 pass, 46 fail (pre-existing), 3 skip — unchanged.
**API cost:** $2.02 total for testing (73 API calls). With Haiku optimization, ongoing cost ~$0.03/session.
**Knowledge quality verified:** GTFS topic generated 9 high-quality sections. Haiku vs Sonnet comparison on reflectorCall1 showed identical output (8 bullets, 0 topics, same categories).

## Session 2: Pipeline + Retrieval Overhaul

### Knowledge Page Architecture: Single Document Model
**Date:** 2026-03-25
**Files changed:** `src/types.ts`, `src/llm.ts`, `src/reflect.ts`, `src/curate.ts`, `src/knowledge-page.ts`, `src/validate.ts`, `src/review-queue.ts`, `test/phase3-reflect.test.ts`
**Key changes:**
- Replaced `KnowledgePageAppendDelta` (section append) with `KnowledgePageUpdateDelta` (full page revision). Alias kept for backward compat.
- Reflector Call 2 output changed from `knowledge_sections[]` to `page_updates[]` — each update is a full revised page body.
- LLM is conservative: keeps both claims when unsure, flags contradictions for review queue.
- `ContradictionItemSchema` + `ContradictionClaimSchema` in types.ts. Claims merge into existing items per topic+section.
- `updatePageContent()` in knowledge-page.ts replaces page body, indexes into FTS after write.
- Curator handles `knowledge_page_update` delta type, reports contradictions via `reportContradiction()`.

### Session Note Improvements
- Added `title` field to SessionNoteSchema + frontmatter. LLM generates 3-8 word title.
- Date headers now include time: "March 25, 2026 — 14:30".
- `user_edited` skip removed — notes always receive appended content.
- `processed` flag only reset on substantial new content (>500 chars).
- Map-reduce summarization for large transcripts (>60K chars): chunk → Haiku summarize each → Sonnet synthesize final note.

### Transcript Browser
- New sidebar tab (◎) listing all transcripts grouped by project.
- Click any transcript to view raw content with chunked loading (500KB, Load More button).
- "Generate Session Note" button for unprocessed transcripts.
- "View Session Note" button for processed ones.
- Backend: `readTranscripts()`, `readTranscriptChunk()` in file-reader.ts, `cliGenerateSessionNote()` in cli-bridge.ts.

### No-Backfill for Old Transcripts
- `installedAt` timestamp in state.json, set on first run.
- `scanForModifiedTranscripts` skips transcripts with mtime before installedAt.
- Old transcripts can be processed manually via transcript browser.

### cm_context Tiered Retrieval Rewrite
- **Tier 1:** Full knowledge page content (auto-included for high-relevance) + knowledge page summaries (for lower relevance) + matching user notes + unprocessed session note summaries.
- **Tier 2:** Processed session note summaries (if Tier 1 < 2K tokens).
- **On-demand:** Agent calls `cm_detail` for full session note bodies or knowledge summaries.
- Knowledge page matching: keyword (word-boundary) + semantic + body content matching. Body matching against page content catches queries like "line map" that don't appear in topic name "GTFS".
- Session summary relevance filtering: stop words excluded, keyword match against title+abstract+topics.
- FTS search uses OR semantics for broader recall.
- `_hint` in response tells agent how to use `cm_detail` for follow-up reads.
- CLAUDE.md updated: agents instructed to call `cm_context` before starting any task.

### Other Fixes
- Source provenance links: knowledge page section sources clickable → navigates to session note.
- External references: prompts updated to preserve URLs in session notes and knowledge pages.
- Session note LLM input capped at 30K chars. Raw path body capped at 30K chars.
- `formatDate()` handles empty/invalid dates gracefully.
- Topic deletion: removes from topics.json + deletes knowledge directory.
- Add topic/sub-page forms in Electron UI.
- Sidebar icons, resizable sidebar (DOM-direct during drag), star buttons on all content types.

### E2E Verification
Tested cm_context → cm_detail flow with multiple query types:
- "add collision detection to line map" → GTFS/_index auto-included (8K chars, rel:0.6), session note about V2 build identified and readable via cm_detail.
- "reflection pipeline" → LLM Pipeline Architecture auto-included.
- "PostgreSQL RLS" (no knowledge) → graceful degradation with session summaries as fallback.
- Full agent simulation: cm_context → picks relevant items → cm_detail → has full architectural context to proceed.
