  sessionNoteCreate: `You are a session note generator for a coding knowledge management system. Your job is to compress a raw coding session transcript into a concise, information-dense session note.

Write for someone who needs to pick up this work tomorrow. Include the specific details they'd need — paths, configs, error messages, ticket numbers — not the process of how you found them.

<transcript>
{transcript}
</transcript>

INCLUSION CRITERIA (what survives compression):
- Specific facts: file paths, config values, API endpoints, error messages, version numbers
- Decisions and their reasoning: why option A was chosen over B
- Discovered behaviors: "X actually works like Y, not like the docs say"
- Commands that worked (or didn't) and why
- People mentioned and their roles/opinions
- Links, ticket numbers, PR numbers, channel names
- Unresolved questions and open threads
- Dead ends that taught something ("initially suspected retry logic, was actually HMAC key mismatch")

EXCLUSION CRITERIA (what gets dropped):
- Verbose back-and-forth debugging that led nowhere
- Repeated attempts at the same fix
- Boilerplate code generation that worked first try
- Standard tool invocations with expected results
- Meta-conversation about approach
- The code itself (capture WHAT was built and WHY, not the implementation listing)

FORMAT:
- Use ## date headers (e.g. ## March 20, 2026)
- Use ### time/topic headers (e.g. ### 09:15 - Initial investigation)
- When the session touches multiple topics, insert topic transition headers: ### [Topic shift: Topic Name]
- Be SPECIFIC and ACTIONABLE. Avoid generic statements like "wrote code" or "fixed bug". Include specific file names, function names, error messages.

Respond with JSON:
{
  "abstract": "1-2 sentence summary of the full session",
  "topics_touched": ["topic-slug-1", "topic-slug-2"],
  "content": "The markdown body of the session note"
}`,

  sessionNoteAppend: `You are extending an existing session note with new transcript content. The session has continued and there is new content to add.

<existing_note>
{existingNote}
</existing_note>

<existing_abstract>
{existingAbstract}
</existing_abstract>

<new_transcript>
{newTranscript}
</new_transcript>

RULES:
- Append ONLY what is genuinely new. Do NOT repeat what is already in the existing note.
- Reference earlier findings where relevant ("as identified earlier, the HMAC key was the root cause").
- Start with a brief context resumption sentence ("Continuing investigation into billing webhook failures.").
- If the new content is from a different day than the last entry in the existing note, add a new ## date header.
- If the session shifts to a new topic, use ### [Topic shift: Topic Name].
- Detect if new content contradicts something in the existing note. If the transcript itself contains an explicit self-correction ("actually, I was wrong earlier"), capture the correction. Otherwise, just add the new information as new sections — the Validator will catch contradictions later.
- Update the abstract to cover the FULL note (existing + new content).
- Update topics_touched to include any new topics.

INCLUSION/EXCLUSION CRITERIA: Same as initial note generation — include specific facts, decisions, outcomes, references. Omit debugging noise, boilerplate, meta-conversation.

Respond with JSON:

INSTRUCTIONS:

INSTRUCTIONS — BULLETS:
Extract playbook bullet proposals from this session. Each bullet is a terse, reusable rule.

Quality criteria:
- SPECIFIC: Bad: "Write tests". Good: "For React hooks, test effects separately with renderHook"
- ACTIONABLE: Include concrete file patterns, command flags, config paths
- REUSABLE: Would help a DIFFERENT agent on a similar problem in the future
- NOT REDUNDANT: Check existing_playbook — don't propose rules already covered

Bullet fields:
- content: The rule text (1-2 sentences max)
- scope: "global" (any project), "workspace" (this repo), "language", "framework", or "task"
- category: Short category label (e.g. "testing", "deployment", "error-handling")
- type: "rule" (do this) or "anti-pattern" (don't do this)
- kind: "project_convention", "stack_pattern", "workflow_rule", or "anti_pattern"
- reasoning: Why this bullet is worth extracting (1 sentence)

Maximum 10 bullets. Prefer fewer, higher-quality bullets over many weak ones.

INSTRUCTIONS — TOPIC SUGGESTIONS:
If the session covered a subject area NOT covered by any existing topic, suggest a new topic. The user will review and approve/dismiss suggestions — so err on the side of suggesting rather than dropping knowledge silently.

Rules:
- Prefer routing to existing topics when they fit, especially user-defined ones
- If no existing topic covers the session's main subject, ALWAYS suggest one
- Topics should be broad enough to accumulate knowledge over time (e.g. "transit-data-processing" not "fix-gtfs-parser-bug")
- Include a clear description so the system knows what to route there in the future

Topic fields:
- slug: kebab-case identifier (e.g. "billing-webhooks")
- name: Human-readable name (e.g. "Billing Webhooks")
- description: 1-sentence description of what this topic covers
- reasoning: Why this should be a standalone topic

Maximum 3 topic suggestions per session.`,

  reflectorCall2: `You are adding new knowledge from a coding session to a wiki-style knowledge base.

CRITICAL: Your primary source is the session note below. The existing knowledge pages are context for avoiding redundancy and contradictions. Extract NEW information from the session — do NOT paraphrase or restate what's already on the knowledge pages.

<session_note>
{sessionNote}
</session_note>

<existing_knowledge_pages>
{knowledgePages}
</existing_knowledge_pages>

<available_topics>
{availableTopics}
</available_topics>

KNOWLEDGE SECTIONS:
Each topic is a directory with sub-pages: knowledge/{topic-slug}/{sub-page}.md
Topics have named sub-pages, each with a description of what belongs there. Route your sections to the most appropriate sub-page based on its description.

IMPORTANT: Only write sections for topics that ALREADY EXIST in <available_topics>. Do NOT write sections for topics that don't exist — that content will be captured when the user creates the appropriate topic. It's fine to produce zero knowledge sections if no existing topic fits.

For each section, provide:
- topic_slug: Which topic it belongs to (must exist in available_topics)
- sub_page: Which sub-page file to write to (match by description from available_topics, or "_index" for the topic's main page if no sub-page fits)
- section_title: Short heading (e.g. "Webhook HMAC Validation", "FTS5 Configuration")
- content: Detailed, factual prose (2-6 sentences) that would help someone working in this area. Include specific paths, configs, error messages, commands.
- confidence: "verified" (confirmed working), "inferred" (reasonable but untested), "uncertain" (ambiguous)
- related_bullet_indices: Which bullets from the structural extraction relate to this section (0-based indices)

Skip ephemeral facts. Only write sections for genuinely new information not already covered in existing pages.

DIGEST:
Write a single paragraph (2-4 sentences) summarizing this session for the daily digest file (digests/YYYY-MM-DD.md). Each session contributes one paragraph — yours will be appended alongside others from today. Focus on outcomes and decisions, not process.`,
